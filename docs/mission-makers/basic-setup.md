# Enabling the Framework

### First enable the framework by ticking the checkbox "Enable UO Framework".
### With enabling the framework you allow all the modules and settings to run.
### After enabling the framework you need to choose the mission type. At this point the Mission Type is just cosmetic.
### Now you need to set the Team Names and their Type. Name stands for the name of the Team and it will be displayed at the end of the mission in the End Screen. For the Type there are 3 Options Player, AI and both. If the type is Player then AI units will be ignored in any counting and in the endconditions. If the type is AI then player units will be ignored in any counting and in the endconditions. For COTVTs set the type to both
### If the Team Name is empty then the team will not be created and shown in the End Screen. It is recommended to only give names to teams which have units on the map.
